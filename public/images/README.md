# Images Directory Structure

This directory contains all the static images used in the portfolio website. Here's how the images are organized:

## Directory Structure

- `/profile/` - Profile pictures and personal photos
- `/projects/` - Screenshots and images related to your projects
- `/skills/` - Icons and images representing your technical skills
- `/achievements/` - Images related to certifications, awards, and accomplishments
- `/background/` - Background images and decorative elements

## Usage Guidelines

1. Keep image files optimized and compressed
2. Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `project-name-screenshot.png`)
3. Prefer SVG format for icons and logos
4. Use WebP or PNG format for photographs and screenshots
5. Maintain consistent aspect ratios within each category
